🎬 Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis and visualization of Netflix movie data using Python.
The aim is to extract meaningful business insights by answering key analytical questions and presenting findings through clear, well-structured visualizations.

The project follows a real-world Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow, making it suitable for data analyst internships and entry-level roles, including Netflix.

🎯 Objectives of the Project

Perform structured data cleaning and preprocessing

Answer 5 core analytical questions

Create multiple visualizations per question

Identify trends related to popularity, ratings, genres, votes, and release years

Demonstrate data storytelling and analytical thinking

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – data manipulation & cleaning

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook (PyCharm)

Git & GitHub

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains Netflix movie information with the following columns:

Title – Movie name

Release_Date – Year of release

Genre – Movie genre

Popularity – Popularity score

Vote_Count – Number of user votes

Vote_Average – Average user rating

Each movie may appear multiple times due to multiple genres, allowing genre-wise analysis.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The following steps were performed before analysis:

Removed missing and inconsistent values

Standardized column formats

Ensured correct data types

Handled duplicate movie-genre records

Prepared data for visualization-ready analysis

📊 Analytical Questions & Insights
Question 1: What is the distribution of movie popularity on Netflix?

Identified highly popular movies

Visualized popularity distribution to understand content reach

📌 Visualizations used: Bar charts, distributions

Question 2: Which genres are most common on Netflix?

Action, Adventure, and Drama appear most frequently

Shows Netflix’s focus on high-demand genres

📌 Visualizations used: Count plots, bar charts

Question 3: Which genres receive the highest popularity and votes?

Action and Sci-Fi genres show strong popularity

Higher popularity correlates with higher vote counts

📌 Visualizations used: Bar plots, comparison charts

Question 4: How do ratings (Vote_Average) vary across genres and years?

Most movies fall in the 6–8 rating range

Ratings remain relatively stable over the years

📌 Visualizations used: Box plots, trend charts

Question 5: What is the relationship between popularity, votes, and release year?

Movies with higher popularity tend to receive more votes

Recent years show increased content production

📌 Visualizations used: Scatter plots, year-wise analysis

📈 Key Insights Summary

Action & Adventure dominate Netflix content popularity

Popular movies receive significantly higher user engagement

Netflix maintains consistent content quality over time

Genre-wise analysis reveals audience preference patterns

Data visualization improves insight clarity and decision-making
